Huntington’s disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion
of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) gene.
Consequently, the mutant protein is ubiquitously expressed and drives pathogenesis of HD
through a toxic gain-of-function mechanism. Animal models of HD have demonstrated that
reducing huntingtin (HTT) protein levels alleviates motor and neuropathological abnormal-
ities. Investigational drugs aim to reduce HTT levels by repressing HTT transcription, stability
or translation. These drugs require invasive procedures to reach the central nervous system
(CNS) and do not achieve broad CNS distribution. Here, we describe the identiﬁcation of
orally bioavailable small molecules with broad distribution throughout the CNS, which lower
HTT expression consistently throughout the CNS and periphery through selective modulation
of pre-messenger RNA splicing. These compounds act by promoting the inclusion of a
pseudoexon containing a premature termination codon (stop-codon psiExon), leading to HTT
mRNA degradation and reduction of HTT levels.

Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant

progressive neurodegenerative disorder. HD is caused by
cytosine–adenine–guanine (CAG) repeat expansions in
the huntingtin (HTT) gene resulting in the production of a ubi-
quitously expressed pathogenic mutant HTT (mHTT) protein1–3.
HD is characterised by progressive atrophy of the striatum, cortex
and other areas of the brain that causes motor, cognitive and
psychiatric symptoms. Neurodegeneration progresses to the tha-
lamus, substantia nigra pars reticulata and subthalamic nucleus in
advanced disease4–6.

Currently, there are no approved disease-modifying treatments
for HD. However, signiﬁcant advancements are being made in
identifying huntingtin (HTT) protein-lowering therapies using
multiple approaches,
including ribonucleic acid (RNA) inter-
ference using short interfering RNAs, short-hairpin RNAs, or
microRNAs and antisense oligonucleotides causing translational
repression or messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation. Transcrip-
tional repression approaches using zinc ﬁnger proteins or clus-
tered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/
CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) have also been employed1,2.
The key challenge for these HTT-lowering therapies is optimal
delivery and distribution throughout the central nervous system
(CNS). These agents do not cross the blood–brain barrier, they
require intrathecal or intraparenchymal delivery, and result in
uneven CNS distribution and inconsistent HTT lowering
throughout the CNS. Peripheral morbidities such as weight loss
and skeletal muscle atrophy can occur and may contribute to
disease severity7,8. Therefore, an orally bioavailable, systemically
distributed, brain-penetrating small molecule that reduces the
toxic burden of mHTT protein uniformly throughout the brain
for HD
and peripheral
management.

tissues would be highly beneﬁcial

We have developed a drug discovery splicing platform to
identify compounds that modulate splicing. This platform can be
used to develop target-selective small molecules, such as the ﬁrst-
ever orally bioavailable modiﬁer of survival of motor neuron 2
(SMN2) splicing for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy
(SMA)9. Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) was discovered using this platform
and has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Admin-
istration and several additional regulatory authorities10. Here, we
describe the discovery of a class of small molecule splicing
modiﬁers that were speciﬁcally synthesised to promote selective
splicing of an inducible pseudoexon containing a premature
termination codon (stop-codon psiExon), reducing huntingtin
mRNA and protein levels in cells and animal models. These
results extend the application of our splicing platform to include
the identiﬁcation of orally bioavailable compounds to treat dis-
eases by decreasing gene expression.

Results
Identiﬁcation of HTT-lowering compounds. HTT-lowering
compounds were identiﬁed by screening ~300,000 diverse mole-
cules from a proprietary chemical
library. The screening was
performed using a highly sensitive and robust HTT protein
detection assay in ﬁbroblasts isolated from HD patients (HD
ﬁbroblasts). Multiple classes of active compounds (hits) were
identiﬁed, including heat shock protein 90 inhibitors (HTT-A)
previously shown to reduce mHTT levels11 (Supplementary
Fig. 1a–c) and splicing modiﬁers HTT-C1 and HTT-D1 (Fig. 1a),
two compounds similar to molecules identiﬁed in the SMA drug
development programme12,13.

HD ﬁbroblasts were treated with the splicing modiﬁers, and
mHTT mRNA and protein levels were determined using reverse
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR),
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) and western blot analysis. Both

HTT-C1 and HTT-D1 dose-dependently decreased mHTT
mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1b–d; Fig. 2a; Supplementary
Fig. 1d). Since most HD patients carry both wild-type (wt) and
mHTT alleles, we quantiﬁed wt HTT protein levels and
control ﬁbroblasts
demonstrated similar decreases
(Supplementary Fig. 1e).

Compounds affect HTT pre-mRNA splicing. HTT pre-mRNA
splice junctions were characterised using primer walking. Dif-
ferential splicing was observed between exons 49 and 54 (Fig. 2b,
Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Splice junctions from these samples
were also analysed using targeted next-generation sequencing
(NGS; AmpliSeq™). The combined results demonstrated that the
compounds induced inclusion of an exon derived from a
sequence inside intron 49 of the HTT pre-mRNA (Fig. 2c–e;
junction expression index (JEI) reduction of >25%; Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2c). This intronic sequence represents a compound-
inducible pseudoexon (psiExon) which, when included, alters the
coding sequence and introduces a premature translation termi-
nation codon, leading to the degradation of HTT mRNA through
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Fig. 2f), and reduction
in HTT protein levels.

Analysis of this stop-codon psiExon shows that it has weak 5′
and 3′ splice sites (ss) (Supplementary Fig. 3). The 5′ss has a
noncanonical GA dinucleotide at the −2 and −1 positions,
differing from the canonical AG sequence. Splicing of exons with
a GAgu 5′ss is inefﬁcient (as is the case with SMN2 exon 714) and
can be enhanced using splicing modiﬁers such as risdiplam9,15,16

Global effects of splicing modiﬁcation. To determine the full
extent of gene expression (mRNA-level) and splicing (exon-level)
changes by HTT-lowering splicing modiﬁers, we performed
RNA-Seq analysis in human SH-SY5Y cells treated with HTT-C2
(branaplam; a more potent, but structurally similar analogue of
HTT-C1), or control (dimethyl sulphoxide; DMSO) (Supple-
mentary Fig. 4a). At 24 nM (twice the inhibitory concentration50
[IC50] of 12 nM), HTT-C2 downregulated the expression of wt
HTT and a few other genes (Fig. 3a). After treatment with 100 nM
HTT-C2, a concentration eightfold the IC50, additional mRNAs
were downregulated, indicating a dose-dependent effect and a
favourable selectivity window for wt HTT over other genes at the
lower concentration (24 nM) (Supplementary data 1).

Splicing analysis demonstrated that, in addition to the HTT
stop-codon psiExon49a inclusion, 165 and 215 splicing events
were altered when treated with 24 nM and 100 nM HTT-C2,
respectively (Supplementary data 2). The majority of splicing
events resulted in inclusion (Inc) or skipping (Skp) of cassette
exons (CE; exons either included or skipped to create distinct
protein isoforms19) (Fig. 3b, c). Inc events were more common
(1.4×–3.3×) than Skp events (Fig. 3d). Similar to HTT stop-codon
psiExon49a, many of the Inc CEs (22% and 44% in 24 nM and
100 nM HTT-C2, respectively), had no annotations for at least
one ss (Fig. 3e; Supplementary Fig. 4b), and had signiﬁcant
enrichment of −2, −1 GA, and −3 A, +3 A sequence at the 5′ss
(represented by AGAguaag) of exons activated by HTT-C2
(Fig. 4a, b, Supplementary data 2). These 31 psiExons are
minimally included at basal level (Fig. 3f; median percent-spliced-
in [PSI] index = 0.7%), poorly conserved (Fig. 3g), shorter
(median size = 64 bps), and with signiﬁcantly weaker 5′ss than
annotated exons (Supplementary Fig. 5). Inclusion of
these
psiExons containing a stop codon or causing frameshift (NMD-
psiExons) were correlated with downregulation of their host

genes (P < 0.05, Fig. 3h, Supplementary data 1), suggesting an
NMD mechanism similar to HTT.

The strong preference for AGAguuag 5′ ss for HTT-lowering
splicing modiﬁers prompted us to compare the effect of the SMN
splicing modiﬁer SMN-C3 (a close analogue of risdiplam) on
mHTT lowering and global splicing changes. We observed that
SMN-C3 demonstrated a striking 170-fold decrement in potency
for mHTT as compared to HTT-C2, whereas the molecules show
similar SMN EC1.5X (Supplementary Fig. 6). When splicing effects
were analysed globally by examination of previously published
RNA-Seq data12, treatment with SMN-C3 led to the generation of
33 psiExons with the predominant consensus of ADGAguaag
(D = U, A or G) (Fig. 4a, b, Supplementary data 2), consistent
with the inclusion of SMN exon 7 with an AGGAguaag 5′ ss.
Together, these data demonstrate that HTT-C2 and SMN-C3
represent two distinct classes of splicing modiﬁers that target 5′ ss
with the noncanonical GA dinucleotide at position −2, −1 of the
5′ ss, with the distinction being a preference for adenosine at
either −3 for HTT-selective molecules or −4 for SMN-selective
molecules.

The strong structure-based sequence selectivity between the
two classes of splicing modiﬁers for HTT and SMN splicing
supports previous data proposing that these molecules bind a
speciﬁc RNA interface created by the noncanonical GAgu 5′ ss in
complex with U113,18. To further validate that the stabilisation of
the U1/pre-mRNA complex leads to the induced inclusion of the
psiExons identiﬁed through our small molecule treatment, we
transfected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells with a

variant U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) (U1-GA variant). This
variant is re-programmed to perfectly bind to a noncanonical
GAgu 5′ss and was shown to activate the wt HTT psiExon49a and
23 other psiExons activated by 100 nM HTT-C2 (Supplementary
Fig. 7a, b). Interestingly, 582 additional psiExons were activated
only by the U1-GA variant (Supplementary Fig. 7b, Supplemen-
tary data 3) and were enriched for GA at the −2 to −1 position of
5′ss, with no preference for adenosine at the −4 or −3 positions
(Supplementary Fig. 7a). These results further support
the
hypothesis that HTT-C2 functions to stabilise U1-5′ss interaction
of a highly selectively subset (AGAguaag 5′ss) of potential
psiExons located throughout
the human genome, although
further experiments are needed to prove a direct interaction.

Elements required for psiExon inclusion. The importance of the
AGAguaag 5′ss sequence of HTT stop-codon psiExon49a and the
species-speciﬁc activity of the compounds was conﬁrmed in a
series of minigene experiments using human and mouse wt HTT
sequences, where alterations to the −2 and −1 sequences
demonstrated requirements for GA and −2, −1 position (Fig. 4c,
d, Supplementary Fig. 8a–d).

Although the RNA-Seq data identiﬁed a limited number of
psiExon inclusion events occurring by either direct or compound-
induced U1 recruitment (n = 609; Supplementary Fig. 7b), we
developed a bioinformatic algorithm (see Methods) and identiﬁed
>58,000 potential psiExons with an AGAguaag 5′ss throughout
the human genome, including four within introns 1, 8 and 40 of

the HTT gene (Supplementary Fig. 8c). The lack of response of
these potential psiExons to either HTT-C2 or the U1-GA variant
suggests that additional sequence elements are required to
promote psiExon inclusion. This is supported by the examination
of splicing of minigenes in which the mutation of −2, −1
positions
to canonical AG of psiExon49a resulted in its
constitutive inclusion, while the same mutation in other potential
psiExons had no effect (Supplementary Fig. 8d).

Bioinformatic analysis of HTT stop-codon psiExon49a identi-
ﬁed a number of potential sequences that could function as
exonic splicing enhancers (ESE) upstream of the 5′ss (Supple-
mentary Fig. 8e). Deletion of 20 nucleotides (−38 to −19), and
more precise partial deletion or mutation of nucleotides CAGGA
at the −38 to −34 positions resulted in the total loss or reduced

compound-induced splicing (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 8f, g),
suggesting the functional importance of this region.

HTT-C2 elicits mHTT lowering in HD mice. As our splicing
modiﬁers require the presence of the human HTT intron 49, we
studied the pharmacodynamic effects of HTT-C2 in the BACHD
mouse model that expresses a full-length human mHTT gene20.
Compound HTT-C2 was evaluated due to its superior exposure
relative to HTT-C1 (Fig. 5a). Daily oral HTT-C2 reduced mHTT
levels within brain tissue of mice in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 5b). Maximal reductions of mHTT levels were achieved by
Day 21 of treatment, with no further reduction observed (Fig. 5c).
These effects were reversible, as protein expression levels returned

to control levels within 10 days of treatment cessation (Fig. 5d).
Uniform >50% mHTT protein-level
lowering was achieved
throughout
the brain following HTT-C2 treatment, most
importantly within the striatum and cortex (Fig. 5e).

Optimisation of HTT splicing modiﬁers. Our splicing modiﬁers
target products of both HTT alleles by promoting HTT stop-
codon psiExon49a inclusion that leads to similar reduction of wt
and mHTT levels (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Research suggests that
50% reduction of mHTT would be beneﬁcial to HD patients, and
a 50% global reduction of wt HTT would be well tolerated21,22,
which highlights the need for therapies that lower HTT in the
brain while not depleting HTT in the periphery. However, HTT-
C2 treatment had a far greater mHTT-lowering effect in per-
ipheral tissues (>90%) than in the brain (Supplementary Fig. 9a).

As P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one major transport protein expres-
sed on BBB, which limits the entry of various drugs into the
CNS23, HTT-C2 and other compounds were tested in an in vitro
assay using Madin–Darby canine kidney cells over-expressing
human P-gp (Supplementary Fig. 9c). HTT-C2 was determined
to be a P-gp substrate. Subsequently, a lower unbound con-
centration of HTT-C2 was conﬁrmed in the mouse brain com-
pared with plasma by measuring the unbound brain partition
coefﬁcient (Kp,uu) (Fig. 5h). This suggests that reduced mHTT
lowering in the brain versus the periphery was most likely
attributed to P-gp efﬂux.

To achieve similar lowering between the periphery and brain,
chemical optimisation led to HTT-D3, an equally potent
compound with reduced P-gp efﬂux (Fig. 5h). Oral administra-

assessed HTT-D3 activity on mHTT splicing. BACHD mice were
given either 1 dose (single dosing) or 21 consecutive daily doses
(multiple dosing) of 10 mg/kg HTT-D3. We observed a similar
response in mHTT mRNA and protein levels in BACHD brain
after compound treatment (Supplementary Fig. 9d). In the Hu97/

critical brain sections, the striatum and cortex (Fig. 5f). Brain and

example of the identiﬁcation and optimisation of orally bioa-

every cell type throughout the brain and periphery) and exert
their action on mHTT splicing and protein lowering evenly
throughout the body. A molecule from our HD drug discovery
programme has recently entered a phase 1 clinical trial.

We initially discovered molecules such as HTT-C2 that low-
ered mHTT levels in the CNS. However, 50% lowering in the
brain resulted in near depletion of mHTT (>90%) in peripheral
tissues. Ablation of wt HTT in mice has been reported to cause
acute pancreatitis due to degeneration of pancreatic acinar cells22.

tical properties. For example, HTT-D3 has even distribution
throughout the body and results in correlative and equal reduc-
tion of mHTT protein levels in plasma and CSF of Hu97/18 mice.
This is a highly desirable proﬁle for oral HD therapy.

The compounds described here lower wt and mHTT mRNA
and protein levels by inducing the inclusion of a stop-codon
psiExon with a noncanonical 5′ss into HTT mRNA, reducing
mRNA levels through NMD and preventing full-length protein
production (International Patent Application Publication Nos.

acting via a similar mechanism.

The strong preference for the noncanonical AGAguaag 5′ss

provide compelling evidence that HTT-C2 and analogues func-
tion as molecular glues to strengthen U1 small nuclear ribonu-
cleoprotein (snRNP) and pre-mRNA 5′ss interaction, allowing
exon recognition by the spliceosome. Furthermore, by utilising a
U1 variant fully complementary to the GAgu 5′ss, we demon-
strate that in addition to the set of compound-induced psiExons,
the U1 variant promoted the inclusion of many additional
psiExons throughout the genome. This result further demon-
strates the stringency and speciﬁcity for adenosine at both the −3
and +3 positions at the 5′ss for compound-induced splicing.
Therefore, at concentrations substantially higher than the HTT-
lowering IC50, these molecules do not cause widespread changes

in gene expression. Together with our results highlight the critical
recognition step in pre-mRNA splicing and how it can be
manipulated by small molecules. The requirement for a predicted
ESE sequence within HTT stop-codon psiExon49a demonstrates
the importance of exon deﬁnition in the activation of potential
compound-induced psiExons. As has been shown for exonisation
of Alu elements, mutation to strong 5′ and 3′ss is not sufﬁcient
for exon recognition by the spliceosome; additional factors are
required, such as serine/arginine-rich protein-binding sites and
ESEs established over thousands to millions of years31. The small
number of psiExon inclusion events, identiﬁed by U1-GA variant
and compound treatment demonstrates this requirement for exon
deﬁnition and highlights the high speciﬁcity of our HTT-selective
compounds, which activate only 31 of >58,000 potential psiExons.
Finally, through comparison of RNA-Seq from SMN-C3 to
that of HTT-C2, we identify a strong preference for A at the –4
and –3 positions of the 5′ ss, respectively, deﬁning two distinct
classes of splicing modiﬁers that target the GAgu noncanonical 5′
ss. Since ~45% of known human exons contain a noncanonical 5′
ss in the −2, −1 position (non-AG; Supplementary Fig. 10),
including GA (1.3% of total Refseq deﬁned exons), our results
suggest that additional noncanonical 5′ss could potentially be
targeted by small-molecule splicing modiﬁers that remain to be
discovered. The insights from our work can lead to the discovery
of therapeutics for diseases of unmet medical need.

Methods
Cell culture. Human B-lymphocytes and ﬁbroblasts derived from the same
homozygous patient with Huntington’s disease (HD) (GM04856/GM04857) and a
healthy donor (GM07492/GM07491) (Coriell Institute for Medical Research),
human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells (ATCC®), human embryonic kidney 293
(HEK293) cells (ATCC); Madin–Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC®);
MDCK cells expressing multidrug-resistance mutation 1 (MDCK-MDR1)
(Absorption Systems); mouse CT26 cells (ATCC) were all grown at 37 °C in a
humidiﬁed 5% CO2 atmosphere. Fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco’s
Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) and 1% antibiotic cocktail (penicillin-streptomycin/
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma con-
tamination. Following the purchase of the cell lines, none of the cell lines was
further authenticated. No commonly misidentiﬁed cell lines were used in the study.

High-throughput screening for the identiﬁcation of HTT-lowering molecules.
Human ﬁbroblasts derived from a homozygous patient with HD (GM4857) were
grown for 96 h in the presence of test compounds (in 0.5% DMSO) or controls at
37 °C in 5% CO2. After 96 h, cells were lysed and frozen. Huntingtin protein (HTT)
levels were measured in lysates as described below. Compounds that decreased
HTT levels relative to DMSO control were further tested in full dose–response.

Quantiﬁcation of HTT protein in cells. For analysis in the ECL assays, test
compounds were serially diluted with a threefold step in 100% DMSO (Sigma®) to
generate a seven-point concentration–response curve. A solution of test compound
(500 nL, 200× in DMSO) was added to each test well; the ﬁnal concentration of
DMSO was 0.5%. Fibroblasts were seeded in 96-well ﬂat-bottomed plates (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc) at 4 × 103 cells/well in 100 µl of culture medium containing the
test compound or DMSO vehicle control and incubated for 96 h (37 °C, 5% CO2,
100% relative humidity). After removal of the supernatant, cells were lysed in 50 μL
of 1× Lysis Buffer11 (LB11) extraction buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 300 mM NaCl,
10% [w/v] glycerol, 3 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM MgCl2,
20 mM glycerophosphate, 25 mM NaF, 1% Triton X-100), containing a Complete™
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics®) with shaking at 4 °C for 30 min;
the plates were then stored at −20 °C.

For western blot analysis, ﬁbroblasts were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in 1 mL
10% FBS/DMEM with GlutaMAX™ supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) in 24-
well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) and incubated for 3–4 h (37 °C, 5% CO2,
100% relative humidity). Cells were then treated with HTT-C1 at different
concentrations (0.5% DMSO) in triplicate wells for 96 h. Cells were lysed in 75 μL
Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.).

washed three times with PBS-T. Cell lysates were transferred to the antibody-
coated plates (25 µl/well) and incubated with shaking overnight at 4 °C. After
removal of the lysates, the plates were washed three times with PBS-T, and 25 µl of
detection antibody in 1% BSA, PBS-T was added to each well and incubated with
shaking for several hours at room temperature. After three washes with PBS-T,
25 µl of SULFO-TAG secondary antibody (MSD; 0.25 µg/ml in 1% BSA, PBS-T)
was added to each well and incubated with shaking for 1 h at room temperature.
After washing three times with PBS-T, 150 µl of read buffer T with surfactant
(MSD) was added to each empty well and the plate was imaged on the SI 6000
imager (MSD) according to manufacturers’ instructions for 96-well plates. Primary
capture antibodies included: anti-polyglutamine-expanded HTT mouse mono-
clonal antibody (mAb) at 1 µg/mL (clone MW1; Developmental Studies Hybri-
doma Bank); anti-HTT mAb at 1 µg/mL (clone 1HU-4C8; Millipore; catalogue #
MAB2166); anti- Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (KRAS) rabbit
polyclonal antibody at 1 µg/ml (Abcam; catalogue # ab137739). Detection anti-
bodies included: Huntingtin (D7F7) XP® Rabbit mAb at 0.25 µg/ml (Cell Signalling
Technology®; catalogue # 5656); anti-human-KRAS mAb at 0.25 µg/ml (clone 2C1;
LSBio; catalogue # LS-C175665-100).

RT-qPCR quantiﬁcation of HTT mRNA in cells. Test compounds were serially
diluted threefold in 100% DMSO to generate a seven-point concentration curve. A
solution of test compound (500 nL, 200× in DMSO) was added to each test well.
Fibroblasts were seeded in 96-well ﬂat-bottomed plates (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)
at 1 × 104 cells/well in 100 µl of culture medium containing the test compound or
DMSO vehicle control and incubated for 24 h (37 °C, 5% CO2, 100% relative
humidity). After removal of the supernatant, cells were lysed in RNA lysis buffer
(1 M Tris-HCL pH 7.4, 5 M NaCl, 10% IGEPAL®CA-630; 50 µL/well) for 1 min at
room temperature, before 50 µL of chilled nuclease-free water was added to each
well; plates were then transferred immediately onto the ice before storing at −80 °C
overnight.

The mRNA levels of the huntingtin gene (HTT) and glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were quantiﬁed using TaqMan-based RT-
qPCR primers and probes (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc; Supplementary Table 1) and
the AgPath-ID™ one-step RT-PCR Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). RNA samples
were transferred (2 μL/well) to the Armadillo 384-well PCR plate (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc) containing 8 μL/well of the AgPath-ID™ one-step RT-PCR reaction
mixture (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) in a ﬁnal volume of 20 μL. The plate was then
sealed with MicroAmp™ Optical Adhesive Film (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) and
placed in the CFX384 Touch™ Real-Time PCR thermocycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Inc.). RT-qPCR was carried out at the following temperatures for indicated times:
Step 1: 48 °C (30 min); Step 2: 95 °C (10 min); Step 3: 95 °C (15 s); Step 4: 60 °C
(1 min); then Steps 3 and 4 were repeated for a total of 40 cycles.

Western blot analysis. HD ﬁbroblasts (GM04857) were treated with compounds
and lysed in 70 μL sample buffer (24-well plates/Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Med-
ium was aspirated, rinsed once with PBS, 70 μL Invitrogen™ NuPAGE™ Sample
Buffer was added, rocked at room temperature for 10 min, and lysates frozen. Cell
lysates were boiled for 10 min—loaded 45 μL/well. Cell lysates (45 µl/lane) were
separated using pre-cast 3–8% Tris-Acetate gels (NuPAGE™ 3–8%, Tris-Acetate,
1.0 mm, Midi Protein Gel, 12 + 2-well; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) for 5–6 h at
130 V. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
(0.45 μM nitrocellulose/Bio-Rad) at 150 mAp in NuPAGE Transfer Buffer (20×
diluted to 1×; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) for 90 min at 4 °C. Membranes were
blocked overnight in blocking buffer (Li-Cor blocking buffer + 0.1% Tween) at
4 °C, washed four times (for 5 min) in PBS + 0.1% Tween (PBS-T; Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (in Li-Cor
blocking buffer + 0.1% Tween). Blots were washed with PBS-T, probed with
secondary antibodies (in Li-Cor blocking buffer + 0.1% Tween) at room tem-
perature for 1 h and washed again with PBS-T. Bound antibodies were visualised
using the Odyssey® imaging system (LI-COR) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-HTT at 1:1000
(clone 1HU-4C8; Millipore; catalogue # MAB2166), anti-utrophin (UTRN) at
1:250 (clone DRP3/20C5; Vector Laboratories; catalogue # VP-U579), anti-
oxidoreductase-protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) at 1:10,000 (Santa Cruz; cata-
logue # SC20132), anti-βactin at 1:10,000 (clone AC-74; Sigma; catalogue # A2228),
anti-GAPDH at 1:1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc; catalogue # PA1-987), anti-alpha
serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT) at 1:1000 (Cell Signalling; catalogue #
9272). Secondary antibodies included: Alexa Fluor® 680 goat anti-mouse immu-
noglobulin G (IgG) at 1:10,000 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc; catalogue # A28183),
IRDye® 800CW donkey anti-mouse IgG at 1:10,000 (Li-Cor; catalogue # 926-
32212), and IRDye® 800CW donkey anti-rabbit IgG at 1:10,000 (Li-Cor; catalogue
# 925-32213).

ECL protein assay. MESO SCALE DISCOVERY® 96-well plates (MSD®) were
coated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS; 30 µl/well). The plates were washed three times with 0.05% Tween-20 in 1×
PBS (PBS-T; 200 µl/well) then blocked (100 µl/well; 5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) in PBS-T) for 5–6 h at room temperature with shaking. Plates were then

B-lymphocytes (GM04856 cells) were plated in six-well plates (Thermoﬁsher) at
5 × 105 cells/well in 2 mL of 10% FBS, DMEM and incubated for 6 h (37 °C, 5%
CO2, 100% relative humidity). Cells were then treated with HTT-C1 at 125 nM (in
0.5% DMSO) in triplicate for 24 h. RNA was puriﬁed with the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen) using the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were prepared for RT-PCR

(described previously in Methods) using 0.04 µL of each primer (at 100 µM). For
reverse transcription and PCR, the following steps were performed: reverse tran-
scription step: 48 °C (15 min); PCR steps: Step 1: 95 °C (10 min), Step 2: 95 °C
(30 s), Step 3: 55 °C (30 s), Step 4: 68 °C (1 min); Steps 2–4 were repeated for 34
cycles, then held at 4 °C. PCR products were separated on 2% pre-cast agarose
E-gels (Invitrogen), stained with ethidium bromide and visualised using a UVP gel
imager (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Primer sets used for primer walking are pro-
vided in Supplementary Table 2.

Ion AmpliSeq analysis of HTT pre-mRNA splicing GM04856 cells were plated
in six-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/well in 2 mL of 10% FBS, DMEM and incubated
for 6 h (37 °C, 5% CO2, 100% relative humidity) before treatment with 125 nM
HTT-C1 (in 0.5% DMSO) in triplicate for 24 h. Cellular RNA was then extracted
and puriﬁed (described previously in Methods). The Ion AmpliSeq technology
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), which is a PCR-based target enrichment and next-
generation sequencing platform, was used as a targeted measure of exons across the
entire HTT transcript, with the goal of monitoring the presence of any (and all)
novel splice variants in the presence of compound. PCR enrichment of HTT exon
targets was accomplished by applying a custom HTT AmpliSeq panel (PTC
proprietary primer set). The panel consisted of two separate PCR primer pools,
each producing 33 amplicons. The complete HTT assay has 66 amplicons (mean
size, 135 bp) covering all 67 exons. The AmpliSeq workﬂow (Supplementary
Fig. 11) included: (a) RNA reverse transcription, (b) target ampliﬁcation, (c) partial
primer digestion, (d) adapter ligation, (e) library ampliﬁcation, (f) sequencing
reaction, (g) sequencing data analysis. For data analysis, AmpliSeq reads (Fastq
format) were mapped to human genome (hg19) using TopHat232 which allows
identiﬁcation of both known and novel splice junctions. For each one of the 66
introns of the HTT gene, we calculated a JEI (Fig. 2c) using the percent of read
supporting the splicing of the exact annotated intron among all reads supporting
the splicing isoforms using either the 5′ss or/and 3′ss of that intron. A JEI value of
100% indicates full splicing of the intron. A JEI value <100% indicates alternative
splicing paths (eg. inclusion of a cryptic exon or use of alternative 5′ or 3′ss).
Biological triplicates were performed for each treatment group. We compared the
difference of JEIs between compound and DMSO treated samples using the
Student’s t test.

Splice-site score. The 5′ and 3′ss MAXENT scores were calculated using
MaxEntScan33 (http://hollywood.mit.edu/burgelab/maxent/
Xmaxentscan_scoreseq.html) representing the strength of splice sites.

Analysis of nonsense-mediated decay. GM04856 cells were treated with DMSO
or 250 nM HTT-C1. After 18 h, cells were treated with 10 µM cycloheximide
(Sigma) or DMSO. Total RNA was isolated after 2, 4 and 8 h and analysed by
endpoint PCR (described previously in Methods).

Transfection. Wild-type and mHTT and U1 minigene constructs were designed at
PTC and synthesised at GenScript®. For U1 constructs 5 × 105 HEK293 cells were
transfected with 2 µg of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or mock control in
six-well plates, using 6 µl Fugene6® (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions; after incubating for 24 h (37 °C, 5% CO2, 100% relative humidity),
cells were treated with either 1 µM HTT-C1 or 0.5% DMSO control and incubated
for 48 h. For HTT constructs, 5 × 105 HEK293 cells were transfected with 50 ng of
plasmid DNA in 24-well plates, using 6 µl Fugene6® according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. After incubating overnight (37 °C, 5% CO2, 100% relative
humidity), cells were treated with varying concentrations of compounds in a ﬁnal
concentration 0.05% DMSO and incubated for 24 h.

RNA-Seq library preparation from SHY5Y and U1 transfected HEK293.
SHY5Y cells were seeded in six-well plates at 6 × 105 cells/well in 2 mL 10% FBS,
DMEM and incubated for 4 h. Cells were then treated with two biological replicates
of HTT-C1 at 24 nM or 100 nM (in 0.1% DMSO), or four biological replicates of
vehicle control (DMSO) for 24 h (37 °C, 5% CO2, 100% relative humidity).
HEK293 cells were transfected with U1-GA variant minigene construct or mock for
48 h (37 °C, 5% CO2, 100% relative humidity).

Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit. RNA concentration

and quality were assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher
Scientiﬁc). For library preparation and sequencing, mRNA was enriched from
~3 µg of total RNA using oligo(dT) beads. The mRNA was fragmented randomly
using fragmentation buffer followed by complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis
using an mRNA template and random hexamers primer. Second-strand synthesis
buffer (Illumina), deoxynucleotides, ribonuclease H and DNA polymerase I were
added to initiate second-strand synthesis. After a series of terminal repair,
A-ligation and sequencing adaptor ligation, the double-stranded cDNA library was
completed through size selection and PCR enrichment. RNA libraries were
sequenced in a HiSeq sequencer (Illumina).

RNA-Seq analysis of pre-mRNA splicing. RNA sequencing reads were mapped
to human genome (hg19) using STAR (version 2.5)34; only uniquely mapped reads
(with MAPQ > 10) with <5nt/100nt mismatches and properly paired reads were
used. For gene expression analysis, the number of reads in the coding sequence

(CDS) region of protein-coding genes and exonic region of non-coding genes were
counted and analysed using DESeq235 (Bioconductor). For splicing analysis, all
junction reads (read with a gap in alignment indicating splicing) were used,
including the ones mapped to unannotated splice sites. Reads were counted for
different exons (for cassette exon [CE]) or exonic regions (for A5′ss or A3′ss). For
each splicing event, a percent-spliced-in (PSI) value was calculated using the
percent of average read number supporting the inclusion among all reads sup-
porting either the inclusion or the exclusion. A minimum of 20 for the denomi-
nator of PSI calculation was required. Otherwise, a ‘NA’ value would be generated.
PSI values for biological replicates were averaged, and the PSI difference between
the two treatment groups was calculated. For a statistical test, a 2 × 2 read counts
table was made for each event, with rows for reads supporting inclusion or
exclusion, and columns for the two comparing sample groups (biological replicates
were combined). Fisher’s exact test was used for the statistical tests. PSI change of
>20% (or < −20%) and P < 0.001 was used to select splicing events being regulated
by the treatment. PSI calculation, Fisher’s exact test, k-mer analysis and statistical
analysis were performed using R (3.5.1).

K-mer analysis. For comparing sequence difference of a particular region for two
groups of exons (e.g., Inc vs. NC) we compared the k-mer (k = 4–6) frequencies of
the two groups by Fisher’s Exact Test (one k-mer vs. all other k-mers, Group 1 vs.
Group 2). The resulting P value was converted to a signiﬁcance score ([SS] = −
S*log10 P value), in which S is the sign indicating enrichment (1) or depletion (−1)
of the k-mer in Group 1.

Sequence logo. Sequence logos were generated using WebLogo36 (University of
California, Berkeley).

Genome-wide identiﬁcation of putative GA-psiExons. We searched the human
genome with “AGAgtaag” sequences (potential 5′ss sequence responding to the
compound) within introns of ReSeq annotated genes. Then 3′ss sequences were
scanned upstreaming of the “AGAgtaag” sequence using MaxEntScan33. A putative
GA-psiExon is deﬁned as an unannotated exon with length between 6 and 200nt
and 3′ss score >2.3.

Minigene constructs. HEK293 cells transfected with minigene constructs were
treated with varying concentrations of test compounds in a ﬁnal concentration
0.05% DMSO and incubated for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated from the cells using
the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) and RNA concentration and quality were
assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). To
determine splicing changes, cDNA was synthesised using the iScript™ cDNA
synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Endpoint PCRs were set up using Platinum™ PCR SuperMix High Fidelity (Invi-
trogen) and the resulting PCR products were separated on 2% E-gels (Invitrogen).
Primers (designed by PTC Therapeutics, supplied by Invitrogen) were directed
against common sequences in the minigene constructs: T7 Forward: 5′-TAATA
CGACTCACTATAGGG-3′; BGH Reverse, 5′-TAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGG-3′.

Animal studies. All in-life animal procedures were performed in a laboratory
certiﬁed by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care (AAALAC) with approval from the Institutional Care and Animal Use
Committee. BACHD20 and Hu97/1824 mice were used, and the genotype of each
BACHD animal was conﬁrmed by an in-house PCR assay prior to enrolment in
the study.

Quantiﬁcation of HTT protein in animal tissues. Test mice were euthanised, and
brain, muscle (quadriceps), other peripheral tissues and blood samples were har-
vested 2 h after the last dose on Day 20. Prior to analysis, crude total protein from
brain and peripheral tissue samples were prepared by sample lysis in MSD assay
buffer 1 (MSD) with Complete™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail added (Roche Diag-
nostics). Tissues were then homogenised using TissueLyser II (Qiagen), plus a
5 mm stainless steel bead. The lysate was clariﬁed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g
for 20 min at 4 °C, and the total protein concentration quantiﬁed with the Pierce™
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture into EDTA collection
tubes. An aliquot (100─200 µL) was added to 1.5 mL of eBioscience™ 1v Red Blood
Cell Lysis Buffer (Thermo Fisher) and mixed well for 5 min before collecting the
white blood cells (WBC) by centrifugation at 400 × g. The supernatant was dis-
carded, and the pellet of WBCs was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C.
Brain and peripheral sample lysates were analysed for hHTT and KRAS protein
expression using the ECL protein assay (described previously in Methods); using
the same method WBC samples were also analysed for hHTT expression but
not KRAS.

Each tissue sample was tested in duplicate using the ECL protein assay and the
average hHTT and KRAS readouts were calculated. The ratio of the mean hHTT
signal to the mean KRAS signal (×1000) was determined for each test animal. The
hHTT/KRAS ratio grand mean for the vehicle group of ﬁve test animals was
calculated, and the fold change relative to the vehicle grand mean was determined

for each test animal in each group. Percent hHTT (%hHTT) lowering normalised
to KRAS was determined for each test animal by subtracting the fold change from
one and multiplying the difference by 100. Each experiment was performed twice
yielding ten %hHTT-lowering values for each treatment group. For each treatment
group, the mean %hHTT lowering plus the standard error of the mean was plotted
as a bar graph. The %hHTT lowering in WBC samples was determined without
KRAS using the grand hHTT vehicle mean, instead of the grand hHTT/KRAS ratio
vehicle mean.

In vivo pharmacokinetic studies. Oral pharmacokinetics (PK) of compounds
were evaluated in wt littermates from the BACHD colony (FVB background). Mice
were treated with test compounds (10 mg/kg) by oral gavage in 0.5% hydro-
xypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) with 0.1% Tween 80. Blood was collected by
terminal cardiac puncture at speciﬁed time points (three mice per time point) and
centrifuged to generate plasma. Brain tissue was collected at the time of blood
collection and homogenised in water. Protein was precipitated from plasma and
brain homogenates with acetonitrile, methanol mixture (5:1, v/v) containing an
internal standard that is a close analogue of the test compounds. The mixture was
ﬁltered through an EMD Millipore MultiScreen™ Solvinert Filter Plate (MSRLN04,
Millipore, Burlington, MA). Calibration standards were prepared in the same
matrix and processed with the testing samples. Filtrates were analysed using an
Acquity ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Waters Cor-
poration) in tandem with Xevo TQ-s Spectrometer (Waters Corporation). Samples
were injected on to a Waters UPLC Acquity BEH C18 Column (2.1 × 50 mm,
1.7 μm) maintained at 50 °C. The injection volume was 3 µL and the mobile phase
ﬂow rate was 0.45 mL/min. The mobile phase consisted of two solvents: a) 0.1%
formic acid in water and b) 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The initial mobile
phase started with 5% solvent B for 0.4 min, which was changed to 98% solvent B
over 0.8 min with linear gradients, and then maintained at 95% solvent B for
another 0.4 min. The drug concentrations were acquired and processed with
MassLynx 4.1 software. PK parameters were estimated using the non-compartment
method within Phoenix® WinNonlin® Build 8.1 (Certara USA, Inc., Princeton, NJ).

In vivo pharmacodynamic studies. BACHD: pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations
were performed in BACHD mice aged 6−10 weeks. Compound or vehicle (HPMC/
0.1% Tween 80) was administered to BACHD mice (ﬁve female mice per group)
once daily for 21 doses (QD×21) by oral gavage; dosing volumes were 10 mL/kg.
Each animal was regularly observed for mortality or signs of pain, distress or overt
toxicity, and ﬁndings were recorded. Body weights were recorded at the start, and
at least once a week, during the course of the study. Tissue samples were obtained
and prepared for ECL protein assay analysis (described previously in Methods)
from each animal.

Hu97/18: both sexes of 2–4-month-old Hu97/18 mice were used. Mice were
maintained under a 12-hour light:12-hour dark cycle in a clean facility with free
access to food and water. Experiments were performed with the approval of the
Institute Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Central Florida.
Mice were treated with vehicle control or 2, 6 or 12 mg/kg of compound daily by
oral gavage for 21 consecutive days. Mice were weighed 3x weekly and observed
daily for general health and neurological signs, including gait, head tilt and circling.
No adverse events were observed, and no mice were removed from the study.

Hu97/18 terminal tissue and sample collection. Mice were anaesthetised with
Avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol, Sigma Aldrich, catalogue # T48402) and secured in
a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting). The ear bars were raised and the nose piece used to
position the mice in a manner that would allow for a near 90° tilt of the head to
access the cisterna magna. A 1 cm2 section of dorsal neck skin was removed, and
muscle layers were completely dissected away to expose the cisterna magna, which
was then cleaned with PBS and 70% ethanol and dried using compressed air. A
50cc Hamilton® syringe with point style 2 and a 12o bevel was then lowered
carefully into the cisterna magna. CSF was slowly withdrawn at a rate of 10 μl/min
using an UltraMicroPump with a Micro4 controller (World Precision Instru-
ments). CSF samples were collected in pre-chilled tubes, centrifuged, then ﬂash
frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at −80 °C.

Whole blood was then collected by cardiac puncture into EDTA-coated tubes
and divided into three aliquots. One was immediately snap frozen, while plasma
was isolated from another and crude peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the
third. Mice were then decapitated, and the brain removed and placed in ice for
~1 min to increase tissue rigidity. During this interval, liver, heart and quadriceps
muscle were isolated and snap frozen. Brains were then micro-dissected into
cortex, hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum, and midbrain/brain stem.

Immunoprecipitation and ﬂow cytometry mtHTT quantiﬁcation. Approxi-
mately 10,000 5-μm carboxylate-modiﬁed latex beads (Invitrogen, catalogue #
C37255) were coupled with capture antibody, HDB4E10 anti-HTT, in 50 μl of
NP40 lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, Halt phosphatase (Thermo
Scientiﬁc, catalogue # 78420) and Halt protease inhibitor cocktails (Thermo Sci-
entiﬁc, catalogue # 78429), 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium ﬂuoride
NaF, 10 mM Iodoacetamide, and 1% NP40). Capture antibody coupled beads were
then combined with 10 μl of CSF, or 20 μl of plasma in triplicate in a 96-well V-

bottom plate (Thermo Scientiﬁc, catalogue # 249944), brought to a total volume of
50 μl in NP40 lysis buffer, mixed well, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next
day, the plate was spun down for 1 min at 650 RCF and supernatant was removed.
Beads were washed three times in immunoprecipitation and ﬂow cytometry (IP-
FCM) wash buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1% BSA, 0.01% sodium
azide). MW1 anti-expanded polyglutamine probe antibody was biotinylated using
EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Thermo Scientiﬁc, catalogue # 21217), and 50 μl of the
diluted antibody was incubated with the HDB4E10 beads bound to mtHTT for 2 h
at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with 200 μl of IP-FCM wash buffer.
Streptavidin–phycoerythrin (PE) (BD Biosciences, catalogue # 554061) was pre-
pared at 1:200 and 50 μl added to each well and incubated at RT, protected from
light, for 30 min. Beads were washed three times with 200 μl of IP-FCM buffer,
resuspended in 200 μl of IP-FCM wash buffer, and ﬂuorescence intensity of ~2000
beads per sample, HDB4E10/MW1 mtHTT bead complexes, was measured using
an Acuri C6 ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Median ﬂuorescent intensity of PE
was measured for each sample to determine relative mtHTT protein levels.

MDCK-MDR1 efﬂux assay. The MDR1 efﬂux assay was conducted at Absorption
System LLC (Exton, PA). In brief, MDCK-MDR1 and MDCK-wt cell monolayers
were grown to conﬂuence on collagen-coated, microporous membranes in 12-well
assay plates (Thermoﬁsher). Compound solutions (10 μM) in permeability assay
buffer (Hanks’ balanced salt solution [HBSS], 10 mM HEPES, 15 mM glucose; pH
of 7.4) were placed in the donor chamber. The receiver chamber was ﬁlled with
assay buffer plus 1% BSA. Cell monolayers were dosed on the apical side (A-to-B)
or basolateral side (B-to-A) and incubated at 37 °C (5% CO2, 100% relative
humidity). Sampling from the donor chambers was performed at 0 and 1 hr; and
from the receiver chambers at 1 hr. Each determination was performed in dupli-
cate. The ﬂux of lucifer yellow was also measured post-experimentally for each
monolayer to ensure no damage was inﬂicted to the cell monolayers during the ﬂux
period. All samples were assayed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spec-
trometry using electrospray ionisation. The apparent permeability (Papp) and
percent recovery was determined using the following equation:

Papp

¼ ðdCr

=dtÞ*V r

=ðA ´ C0

Þ

dCr/dt represents the slope of the cumulative receiver concentration vs. time in
μM/s; Vr is the volume of the receiver compartment (cm3); Vd is the volume of the
donor compartment in (cm3); A is the area of the insert (1.13 cm2 for 12-well); C0
is the average measured concentration of the donor chamber at time zero in μM;
net efﬂux ratio is deﬁned as Papp(B-to-A)

−Papp(A-to-B).

Unbound brain partition coefﬁcient (Kp,uu). The unbound brain partition coef-
ﬁcient (Kp,uu) is deﬁned as the ratio between unbound brain-free drug con-
centration and unbound plasma concentration. It was calculated using the
following equation:

K p;uu

¼ Cbrain

*f u;b

=ðCplasma

*f u;p

Þ

Cbrain and Cplasma represent the compound concentrations in brain and plasma,
respectively. fu,b and fu,p are the unbound fraction of each testing article in brain
and plasma, respectively. Both fu,b and fu,p were determined in vitro using the
Pierce device for rapid equilibrium dialysis at Absorption System LLC (Exton, PA).
Kp,uu was calculated individually for each animal from multiple mouse PK

studies and the average values are reported here.

Quantiﬁcation of human HTT mRNA in animal brain. One group of transgenic
BACHD mice in the study was orally administered a single dose of HTT-D3 at
10 mg/kg. One group (three mice) was administered vehicle alone on the same
schedule. Dosing volumes were 10 mL/kg based on individual mouse weights.
Dosing solutions were prepared once as the free base HTT-D3 dissolved in a
vehicle comprising 0.5% HPMC and 0.1% TWEEN® 80 and stored at ambient
temperature. Samples of brain tissues were obtained at 2, 4, and 8 h post HTT-D3
dosing. Samples were taken from the vehicle control mice at 2-h post vehicle
dosing. Brain samples for each time point were obtained from three mice per group
and total RNAs were prepared for analysis. Total RNAs from brain tissues were
prepared following sample homogenisation and lysis in QIAzol Lysis Reagent using
TissueLyser and the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen #74804, Germantown,
MD) according to the instructions provided in the manufacturer’s kit.

Quantitative RT-qPCR was performed on ~50 ng of total RNA using AgPath-
ID™ One-Step RT-qPCR Reagents (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions using the custom TaqMan gene expression assays
detailed in Supplementary Table 3.

An RT-qPCR reaction mixture of primers and probe sets for HTT and GAPDH

was prepared according to Supplementary Table 4.

A volume of 2 μL of the RNA preps was transferred from each well to the
Armadillo 384-well PCR plate containing 8 μL/well of the RT-qPCR reaction
mixture that was prepared as detailed in Supplementary Table 4. The plate was
then sealed with MicroAmp™ Optical Adhesive Film and placed in the C1000
thermocycler. The RT-qPCR was carried out at the following temperatures for the

Step 4: 60 °C (1 min); then, repeated Steps 3 and 4 for a total of 40 cycles.
The ampliﬁcation efﬁciency was calculated from the slope of the PCR

ampliﬁcation curve for HTT and GAPDH individually. The abundances of HTT
mRNA and GAPDH mRNA were then calculated as (1 + E)−Ct, where Cycle
threshold (Ct) is the threshold value for each amplicon. The abundance of HTT
mRNA was normalised to GAPDH abundance. The normalised HTT mRNA level
was then used to calculate the percent splicing in the HTT-D3-dosed group
compared to the vehicle-treated group using a modiﬁed 2−ΔΔCT method37.
